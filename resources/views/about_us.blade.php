                    virgo furnishers was a company that started small by just reselling some material for furniture and even
                    sell some furniture that are imported from a lot of other counties but now it has grown into a big
                    company which not only sell imported goods, we also offer customer to make a custom furnitore for them
                    with the highest quality of materials of the customer choice, that are made by some experts at first we
                    only want our customer to have the best imported goods but as times pass by we see a lot of customer
                    doesn't like the size of the furniture, the materials of the furniture, the colors, or even the design
                    that we offer so started from 2020 we were able to give customer a choice to make a custom furniture
                    based on what design they want, what color, size, material, etc.
